# Project-1-EKF
Implementation of Extended Kalman Filter for quadrotor state estimation by fusing IMU and Vicon data

## Setup
Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Lb3spfN2pWJxw6UBiNjGD65PiUzzj0yH) and extract it inside the 'data' folder.
## Part 1
Perfomed Extended Kalman Filter using measurement provided by VICON in the form of pose(position and orientation).
